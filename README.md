AI Video Highlight Editor 🎥✨
Overview:
The AI Video Highlight Editor is a cutting-edge desktop application built with PyQt5 that leverages advanced audio and video processing algorithms to automatically generate highlight reels from user-selected video files. Designed for content creators, sports analysts, and casual users alike, this tool intelligently identifies key moments by analyzing both audio peaks and visual motion within videos — streamlining the otherwise tedious manual editing process. 🚀

Key Features 🔑
Multi-Modal Analysis 🎵🎬
Utilizes a hybrid AI-driven approach combining audio analysis (detecting significant sound events) and video motion detection (identifying visually dynamic scenes) to accurately pinpoint the most important moments in footage.

Customizable Video Quality 🎞️
Offers three selectable output qualities — Low (1000k), Medium (3000k), and High (6000k) bitrate — allowing users to balance between file size and visual fidelity according to their needs.

User-Friendly GUI 🖥️
A sleek, modern dark-themed interface with clear prompts and feedback messages guides users seamlessly through selecting videos, choosing output folders, and initiating highlight generation.

Background Processing & Progress Feedback ⏳
Employs multithreading to keep the interface responsive during processing. Users receive real-time updates on current steps via a progress bar and descriptive status messages with fun emojis, enhancing user engagement.

Automatic Highlight Generation ✂️
Automatically extracts clips surrounding detected moments (5 seconds per highlight), then concatenates them into a cohesive highlight video — ideal for quick reviews or social media sharing.

Robust Error Handling ⚠️
Comprehensive exception management ensures any issues during processing are gracefully reported to the user without crashing the application.

Technical Details 🛠️
Audio Analysis:
Uses the Librosa library to load and analyze audio tracks, identifying peaks in the onset envelope to detect sound events such as cheers, applause, or sudden noises indicative of highlight-worthy moments.

Motion Detection:
Implements frame-by-frame comparison with OpenCV to detect significant visual changes. Frames with pixel differences exceeding a threshold trigger motion timestamps to capture action sequences.

Highlight Compilation:
The moviepy library handles video editing — cutting segments around detected times and stitching them together with customizable bitrate and encoding presets to optimize output quality.

Threaded Worker:
The HighlightWorker QThread ensures intensive computation runs in the background, communicating progress and errors back to the main GUI thread safely via PyQt signals.

User Workflow 🧑‍💻
Select Video File 📁 — Choose a source video in popular formats (.mp4, .avi, .mov).

Choose Output Folder 🗂 — Designate where the highlight video will be saved.

Pick Video Quality 🎥 — Select preferred bitrate for the output highlight.

Generate Highlights ✨ — Start the automated process.

Review Results 🎉 — Receive notifications on completion and access the generated highlight video instantly.

Benefits & Use Cases 🎯
Content Creators: Quickly generate engaging highlights for YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram.

Sports Analysts: Effortlessly extract critical moments for game review and commentary.

Event Planners: Summarize long recordings from conferences or celebrations.

Everyday Users: Turn family videos into shareable highlight reels with minimal effort.

Summary
The AI Video Highlight Editor empowers users to transform lengthy video footage into concise, impactful highlight compilations through an intuitive, emoji-enhanced interface. Its blend of audio-visual AI techniques and seamless user experience makes video editing accessible to all skill levels — saving time while delivering professional-grade results. 🎬✨
